🌟 Energy Flow : Performance & Trend Dashboard — Project Summary

This project presents an end-to-end Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize energy consumption patterns and carbon emissions across multiple dimensions such as season, location, and energy type. The goal of this dashboard is to transform raw energy data into actionable insights that support sustainability tracking and data-driven decision-making.

🚀 Project Overview

The Energy Flow Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of:

Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy Consumption

Total Energy Consumption

Carbon Emissions and Emission Factor (KG CO₂/kWh)

Seasonal and Monthly energy performance

Location-wise comparisons

Interactive trend analysis across years

The dashboard uses a dark-themed UI, optimized visuals, and dynamic interactivity powered by DAX and slicers for an intuitive analytical experience.

🧠 Key Features
🔹 1. Interactive Metric Switching

Implemented using advanced DAX functions like SWITCH, enabling users to toggle between different metrics including:

Renewable Energy

Non-Renewable Energy

Total Consumption

Energy Cost

Carbon Emission

Emission Factor

🔹 2. Season-Wise Carbon Emission Analysis

A donut chart visualizes CO₂ distribution across Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn, highlighting high-emission seasons through intuitive color patterns.

🔹 3. Location-Based Energy Insights

Bar and line charts allow comparison of energy usage and emissions across various locations, supporting performance benchmarking.

🔹 4. Line Trend Visualization

Year-over-year trend analysis through line visuals helps identify consumption patterns and seasonal spikes in emissions.

🔹 5. Dynamic DAX Measures

Custom DAX measures were built for:

Total Energy Consumption

Emission Factor (kg CO₂/kWh)

Carbon Emission totals

Metric switching logic

Seasonal grouping using date intelligence

🔹 6. Clean Dark Theme UI

The dashboard uses a consistent color palette and layout, with color-driven insights:

Green/Yellow → low emissions or positive performance

Orange/Red → high emissions or critical areas

🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

Power BI Desktop

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Power Query (for data transformation)

Data Modeling (Calendar table, relationships, calculated columns)

GitHub (Documentation & Versioning)

📊 Data Modeling Highlights

Built a dedicated Calendar table for proper time intelligence

Added a custom Season column using SWITCH logic

Structured relationships between fact and dimension tables

Used CALCULATE, ALLEXCEPT, DIVIDE, DATEADD, and SUMX for accurate context filtering and aggregation

🎯 Purpose & Impact

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Build complete BI solutions

Translate raw datasets into visual narratives

Apply analytical thinking and business context

Create modern, professional dashboards

Use DAX efficiently for dynamic and scalable reporting

Ideal for sustainability tracking, energy management insights, and performance monitoring.
